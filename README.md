## Simple Contact Manager ##

The goal of this contact manager is to provide a simple, clean interface to perform basic operations with a database of contact information. You can add view, add, delete, search, import, and export contacts.

#### Feature List ####

Need to have:
- View, add, edit, and delete records
- Data validation
- Feedback UI
- Welcome screen

Need to have:
- Search

### Things to Know ###

Data validation appears to be:
-   First name is required

-   Email is string@string.string format

-   URL must start with http

-   Zip code appears to not allow null values in the database and defaults to 0
